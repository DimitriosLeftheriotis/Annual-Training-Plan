# Annual Training Plan

## 📝 Abstract
This proposal involves creating an application that graphically displays the annual training plan regarding the intensity and volume of an athlete's training in each training period. The application will also show training periods and other significant events for the athlete's development on an annual basis.

## 🌟 Features
- **Graphical Display**: Annual training plan with intensity and volume.
- **Training Periods**: Display of mesocycles and significant events.
- **Data Management**: Input data from coaches regarding the athlete's health and development.

## 📋 Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

## ⚙️ Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/TrainingPlanApp.git
   cd TrainingPlanApp
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install flask matplotlib numpy webbrowser threading io base 64
   ```

## 🚀 Running the Application
Start the Flask server:
```bash
python app.py
```
The application will run on http://localhost:5000 by default.

## 🔧 Methodology
- The majority of the code is written in Python, utilizing Flask.
- HTML and JavaScript is used to create a user-friendly interface.
- The application runs on port 5000 for the purposes of the project but can be deployed to a server if needed.
- The libraries matplotlib, numpy, flask, webbrowser, threading, io και base64 were used to support the application.
